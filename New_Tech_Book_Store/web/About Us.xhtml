                <p align="left" style="font-family: 'GILL',HELVETICA, sans-serif;color: black;">In USA, shopping for books has always been thought of as a book-lover's hobby.
            The traditional bookstores, with their dreary, dusty and browser-unfriendly atmosphere, have
            discouraged all but the serious book-buyers.
            </p>
                <p align="left" style="font-family: 'GILL',HELVETICA, sans-serif;color: black;">
